# Tetris
This is a personal project. I wanted to challenge myself and create a single player tetris game with pygame and my actual knowledge of OOP and Python.

I tried to keep it simple and only implemented the basic mechanics of the game.
To play, you need to use the arrow to move the block (Right, Left, Down) and the UP key to rotate your block (to the right only). You can also hold your block by pressing E
